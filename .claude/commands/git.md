# Git instructions

Make the commits of the modified files for my current repository following the conventional commits principle. Always remember to ask me before each commit maded giving me a preview of your commit.

## Important

- Create different branches for each feature (feat)
- In the case of refactor, fix, chore and others you can open the feature/[feature] related branch and do the commit
- Allways folow the pattern feature/[feature] when naming the branches
